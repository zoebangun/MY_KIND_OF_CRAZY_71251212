My Kind of Crazy (Feat. Dipha Barus) â€“ Raisa

A quiet morning 
You by my side
Got nowhere to be
Nowhere that I would be

Come closer, baby
Your skin to mine
It's not complicated
Just do what we do naturally 
By my side, my side

And this is all whatever this to me
Your touch or your smile at the morning light 
Pull me inside out and set me free
Baby let's go, don't you hesitate
